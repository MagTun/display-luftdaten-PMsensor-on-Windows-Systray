## PM watch in systray
`PM general.py` displays the PM10 value of a luftdaten PM sensor in the systray (tested on Windows 10).  
You can have several icons displaying the data from several sensors but using (duplicating) the `PM1.py` script. 

Use this [version](https://github.com/MagTun/infi.systray/tree/develop/src/infi/systray) of sys.tray (so the context menu of icon are updated when mute/unmute)
